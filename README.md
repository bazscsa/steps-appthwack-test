# Step Annotated template

This folder contains an annotated Step template - everything what's required
to be included in your Step repository.

You can find a **full template Step repository on GitHub**: [https://github.com/steplib/step-template](https://github.com/steplib/step-template).

Technically all what's required is a *step.sh* and a *step.yml* file,
but we advise you to include at least a *README* and a *LICENSE* file too
as a best practice.

**Read the included LICENSE file for more information about why it's
important to include a license in your open source code!**


*You can also include a link to the StepLib website, including your
own Step's page on StepLib in your README file, something like this:*

*This Step is part of the [Open StepLib](http://www.steplib.com/), you can find its page on StepLib [here](http://www.steplib.com/step/your-step-id).*
