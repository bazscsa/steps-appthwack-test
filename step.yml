  Description of the step, in **markdown format**.

  You can include [links](https://github.com/steplib/steplib)
  to help the user of the Step in the setup process (for example
  if the step requires authentication tokens for a service then you
  should include the links where the user can get those tokens).

  *You can include lists, for example a step-by-step guide*:

  1. Add this Step to your workflow
  2. Generate the required authentication tokens
  3. ?
  4. Profit

  The point of the description is to provide a good overview of
  what your step does and a guide for a new user on how to
  do the setup.
# website: can be the step's github page or a dedicated website if you have one
website: https://website.url/of/your/step
# fork and source url: a website url where others can see the code of
#  this step and fork the step's repository (or a description of
#  how others can contribute to the development of this step).
#  Usually this is just the GitHub page of your step.
fork_url: https://github.com/your-github-user/the-github-step-repo
# source, with the git repository url
#  at the moment we only accept GitHub, open repositories
source:
  git: https://github.com/your-github-user/the-github-step-repo.git
# OS tags, in this form:
#  [short-os-code]-[the.os.version.number]
# You should test your step on all the listed OS versions!
host_os_tags:
  - osx-10.9
  - osx-10.10
# if this step is specifically made for a build system
#  or project type you can list those as tags
project_type_tags:
  - ios
# Type tags: regular tags, used for searching, filtering or grouping
#  on websites.
type_tags:
  - example
  - sample
# If your step doesn't require an administrator user account
#  to run properly then you should keep this 'false'
is_requires_admin_user: false

# Inputs:
#  Inputs are a list of environment keys and user-friendly titles
#  The step runner should map the given input's content (the one the user
#   specifies) to the specified environment key.
inputs:
  - title: "Title of input 1"
  - description: |
      Description of the input. Optional.
      You can include longer guides / notes here
      in *markdown* format if you have to.
      
      For example you can describe how a user
      can obtain a Token for a service and then
      copy the token as the value of this input.
# mapped_to is the Environment Variable's name which will contain
#  the value the user provides for this input.
    mapped_to: ENVIRONMENT_KEY_OF_INPUT1
# if is_expand is 'true' then the value of this input should be
#  expanded based on the current environment variables.
# For example if it contains $HOME then before the input would be
#  assigned to the 'mapped_to' environment key $HOME should be
#  expanded to the current value of the $HOME environment variable!
# If it's false then it should be kept as a text - as it is provided -
#  and environment variables should _not_ be replaced within the input's value!
    is_expand: false
# you can mark inputs which are essential for the Step to run
#  correctly as "required"
    is_required: true
# if you have a list of the acceptable values for this input
#  you can list those as `value_options`. This means
#  that the user should only be able to specify these values
#  for the input. Every input value is interpreted as string/text.
    value_options: ["true", "false"]
# You can define a default value for this input.
#  The input value is interpreted as string/text.
    value: "true"
# You can also mark inputs with a "don't change" flag.
#  This means that the default value you provided for the step
#  should not be changed by the user.
# This flag is used for creating step variants/flavors
#  where you have a complex base step and you define a few
#  variants with pre-defined inputs.
# A user can then use the easier step-flavor (fewer inputs to fill out)
#  instead of the more complex base step.
    is_dont_change_value: false
  - title: |
      Title of input 2
    mapped_to: ENVIRONMENT_KEY_OF_INPUT2
    is_expand: true

# Outputs:
#  Similar to inputs the outputs is a list environment variables.
#  Title is meant to be presented on UIs, and the "mapped_to" parameter
#   identifies the environment-key your step will generate.
#  Your step is responsible to generate these outputs,
#   it's not automatic. This list is used for connecting steps with each other,
#   your Step's outputs are expected to be available for another step
#   as input if that runs after your step.
outputs:
  - title: |
      Title of output 1
    mapped_to: ENVIRONMENT_KEY_OF_OUTPUT1
  - title: |
      Title of output 1
    mapped_to: ENVIRONMENT_KEY_OF_OUTPUT1
